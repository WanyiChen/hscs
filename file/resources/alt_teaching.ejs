<h2>An alternative way of teaching</h2>
<br>
<p>There are efforts to integrate the unit “Introduction to Algorithms” in the mandatory math course III with the IT elective Algorithm and Program Design, since both have a focus on algorithms. Some researchers think that both the math course and the IT course can benefit from the integration: for math, some math teachers are not very familiar with CS algorithms, and learning the material just on pen and paper can be boring. Yet due to high pressures to prepare students for the NCEE, math teachers usually do not have time to let the students actually program and test their algorithms on computers. For IT, as a marginalized curriculum, some students don’t take it very seriously, so it may use math, the “mainstream curriculum”, to elevate its status <a href="/bib/?entry=xu">(Xu 2013)</a>. In an experiment, students take these two courses at the same time, and program some exercises from the math course in IT class time. Results showed that both the student’s interest and grade improved in comparison to the control group, although it remains unclear whether the results are replicable <a href="/bib/?entry=xu">(Xu 2013)</a>.</p>
