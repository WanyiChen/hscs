<h1>About</h1>
<br>
<p>
My name is Wanyi Chen, and I am an undergraduate student in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I did not learn computer science in high school. When I first came across computer science in college and immediately became interested in it, I suddenly wondered why I had not known it earlier. That small curiosity soon grew stronger and stronger.
</p>
<p>
In fall 2016, I did an independent study with Prof. <a href="https://aeshin.org" target="_blank">Ryan Shaw</a> in the School of Information and Library Science to study CS education in U.S. and Chinese high schools. This site is an experiment to present the research results in non-linear hypermedia instead of a regular research paper. By building an interactive websiteï¼ŒI wish to present the research in a more engaging, personalized way.
